- **1.0.0** (2024-XX-XX): Initial release

## Upgrade Notes

### Upgrading to 1.1.0

If you're upgrading from a previous version:

1. **Pull latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Update Docker configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

3. **Rebuild Docker images**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**:
   ```bash
   ./docker/verify.sh
   ```

## Migration Guide

### From GitHub Pages to Docker

1. Stop GitHub Pages deployment (if active)
2. Follow Docker quick start guide: [docker/QUICKSTART.md](docker/QUICKSTART.md)
3. Configure environment variables in `.env`
4. Start services: `docker-compose up -d`

### From Local Development to Docker

1. Commit your local changes
2. Create Docker environment: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Build and start: `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access application: http://localhost:3000

## Breaking Changes

### 1.1.0

- No breaking changes for existing deployments
- New Docker deployment option is fully backward compatible
- GitHub Pages deployment continues to work as before

## Known Issues

### Docker on Windows

- Some Windows users may experience slow builds. Use WSL2 for better performance.
- Port conflicts may occur with other services. Configure custom ports in `.env`.

### SSL Certificates

- Self-signed certificates will show browser warnings. Use Let's Encrypt for production.

## Future Plans

### Planned for 1.2.0

- [ ] Kubernetes deployment configurations
- [ ] Enhanced monitoring and logging
- [ ] Automated backups
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Additional quality metrics
- [ ] More profile versions

### Under Consideration

- [ ] GraphQL API support
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Multi-tenant support
- [ ] CLI tool for automation
